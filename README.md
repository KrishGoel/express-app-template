# 🌐 Express.JS App Template
> Generated using Express App Generator

This is a dummy tempate for a generic Node.JS Express Web App using Pug and Stylus for rendering HTML and CSS. It's mainly for enabling quick dev in machines where it's hard to build the file structuring and saving times in terms of setup.

I mostly use this for development on 🏫 school machines.

## Directions for use
1. Make sure you have Node.JS and npm installed
2. Open CLI in your working folder
3. ```$ git clone https://github.com/KrishSkywalker/expressAppTemplate.git``` to clone the Github repository
4. ```cd expressAppTemplate``` to switch your working directory to the newly cloned Git repo
5. ```npm i``` to install all the Node modules in case some are left even though I have tried to included everything
6. ```npm start``` to finally run the server

Your local Express server should now start running on port 3000 i.e. ```localhost:3000``` 🎉.

✨ Since nodemon is already installed, you won't have to restart your server each time you edit your app.js (routing etc.).

**PS:** Please make sure you edit the package.json to suit your project details 😄

🎊 Get this party started
